Hello, I'm John, and I'll tell you about my usua day. I'm a biology teacher, so I usually wake up early and take a cold shower.
I go to school at 7 AM and teach my students about plants and animals.
I have lunch at school and talk with my coworkers. When I come back home, I cook dinner with my wife, and then we play with our kids.
Lastly, I relax by watching some TV before going to bed
